# project-GREASE-MONKEY
This is My First git hub project which is based on ONLINE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR AUTOMOBILE REPAIR
The project GREASE MONKEY is a web-based application which can run on any browser in mobile, tablet or computer.
This website will enable any vehicle user to search and communicate with any mechanic in the vicinity. 
The user can also send request for pick up service. This website also enables user to find nearby hospitals.
The system uses database for storage and hosting purposes. Database uses SQL for storing the data of the website which includes user’s details, admin account and mechanic details etc.
Frontend of the system is designed in VS code which uses HTML5, CSS and type script for better designing of the website. Whenever the user uses the website, user’s location is derived
from their device and then the user is provided with locations of nearby mechanics and their service rating. The user is then free to select a mechanic by his/her choice.
After a mechanic is selected by the user, user’s information like location is sent to the choosen mechanic provided that mechanic is not busy and they accept the user’s request to provide the service and payment will be done online or offline.
The objective of this study is to find out the different factors responsible for effecting servicing and maintenance process of a automobile and to look for opportunities to reduce time required for it .
